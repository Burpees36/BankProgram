# CS-210-ClocksProgram

## Project Summary: 
I created an application that allowed a user to set an initial investment, monthly deposits, interest rate, number of months and display their return with and without monthly deposits. The project is in C++ and consists of 3 files. The program had the following requirements:
  Develop an object-oriented programming (OOP) application using secure and efficient C++ code. Make sure that your application:
  1. Meets all specifications listed in the Airgead Banking App Functional Requirements
  2. Follows best practices described in the Airgead Banking Standards document
  3. Includes in-line comments

## What did you do particularly well?
I did well with my user input validation and having the proper functions to get the annual interest rate correct and print for each year.

## Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could improve the structure of the code, making a function for the expressions that kept getting repeated.

## Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The hardest part for me was getting the correct function to print the interest rate. I spent a lot of time there, but it's why it is also one of the things I ended up doing well.

## What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or coursework?
The input validation structure is something I can transfer to other projects, as well as splitting the program into separate files to help maintainability.

## How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Defining the class in the h file, writing the bulk of the code in the cpp file, and keeping main with minimal code was the best thing to help maintainability and readability. It would be easy to go back and update any functions if needed.
